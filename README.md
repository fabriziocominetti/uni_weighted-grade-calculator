# University Weighted Average Calculator

Calculate your university average score with python and pandas!

-- Project status: [Completed]

## About

I've created this notebook to simply calculate my average weighted scores during my university studies.

I've developed two versions of this project. The first one lets you create your dataframe inside the notebook, while the second one directly read a CSV file in input.

Use the first one if you don't have a CSV file containing your scores with the specified columns, while use the second one in the other case.

You can add as much classes as you want. You can also keep an updated CSV file containing your classess and results, or you can regularly updated the content of the notebook.
